Add proposals for Architecture WG collaboration here.

These are mostly free-form documents, that should answer a few base questions:

 * What specifically do you think is in need of architectural design
   work in OpenStack?

 * What background supports your claim that there's need to spend
   resources analyzing, designing, and changing OpenStack in this way?

 * Do you have ideas for what the Architecture Working Group would do
   with this proposal? This would generally be, but is not limited to,
   some of the following things:

   * Produce an accurate analysis on the current state of [topic].

   * Produce a cross-project spec and/or community goal for OpenStack
     to work to support findings.

   * Find and integrate existing solutions from outside OpenStack via
     drivers/plugins/etc.

As long as the proposal is on-topic for OpenStack, we will merge it
and begin work to either accept it and gather support for working on
it, improve the proposal, or reject it. The ultimate goal is to move
the proposal out of here into backlog or active. The proposal should be
ammended with next-steps before or while it is moved to backlog or active.
Rejected proposals will be moved to rejected.
